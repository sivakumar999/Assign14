Time Complexity of Bubble Sort:
	Best-case time complexity: O(n) (when the input array is already sorted).
	Average-case time complexity: O(n^2).
	Worst-case time complexity: O(n^2).

Advantages of Bubble Sort:
	Simple to understand and implement.
	Requires minimal additional memory space (in-place sorting).
	Performs well on small datasets or partially sorted arrays.
	Best-case time complexity is linear (when the array is already sorted).

Disadvantages of Bubble Sort:
	Inefficient for large datasets due to its quadratic time complexity.
	Not recommended for practical use on large or unsorted datasets.
	Performance degrades quickly with an increase in the number of elements.


Bubble sort have more swaps,Checks the neighbour element and swap if required	

selection sort have Less swaps compared to bubble sort,Works by repeatedly finding smallest number in array and swapping

Insertion sort have less number of swaps, Transfer an element at one time to construct a sorted array.
